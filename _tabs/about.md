Hi!

My name is William Liu (刘胥飞/劉胥飛/류서비). I am a software engineer, computer scientist, and cognitive scientist.

My current "life's mission" is to make health and healthcare available and financially accessible for the average American.

To that end I am building a digital health + fintech startup.

I am currently based in San Francisco, and am originally from Madison, Wisconsin.

# Professional

**Currently,** I am building a digital health + fintech startup.

**Previously,** I was an Machine Learning Engineer II at [Amazon Search](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/search-and-information-retrieval). And before that I was the Founding Engineer at [Trainwell](https://trainwell.net),
a remote personal training and wellness startup, where I did a bit of everything.

**Generally,** I am very passionate about health and healthcare, and love working on messy and complex system design.

# Academic

I received my Bachelor of Science in [Cognitive Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/undergraduate/prospective-students/academics/cognitive-science/index.html) with a minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) from Carnegie Mellon University. While at CMU, I had the pleasure to do research with [Saugata Ghose](https://ghose.web.illinois.edu/) on Computer Architecture and Operating Systems for the majority of my undergraduate career.

I also completed graduate course work in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate-program/masters-program/msonline) at The University of Texas at Austin. I worked with professor [Amy Pavel](https://amypavel.com/) on some Human-AI Interaction research while I was there.

Generally I enjoy topics in parallel systems, compilers, and Human-AI interaction.

# Personal

Outside of my professional and academic interests I'm also passionate about [tricking](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuBzUssFYV3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), [esports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFIJFlpMRm4), anime and manga, and filmmaking.

I also love languages. Recently I've been [learning Japanese](/posts/japanese_six_months) in my free time ~~so that I can watch anime without subtitles~~.

You can find blog posts with detailed descriptions of my projects [here](/categories/project/). I also try my best to put my projects up on GitHub and keep them updated, but we all know that is rarely true :')

Hi!

My name is William Liu (刘胥飞/劉胥飛/류서비). I am a software engineer, computer scientist, and cognitive scientist.

I love working on problems in many domains: parallel systems and algorithms, domain-specific compilers, mixed reality, and applications of cognitive science.

I am currently based in the SF Bay Area, though I am originally from Madison, Wisconsin.

## Professional

**Currently,** I am a Software Development Engineer II at Amazon on the [Search Science](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/search-and-information-retrieval) team. I am the tech lead of the ranker models development platform for Amazon.com's Search feature.

**Previously,** I was the Lead Backend Systems Engineer at [CoPilot](https://mycopilot.com/), a startup that's transforming the fitness, personal training, and wellness industry. As the lead "backend guy" I worked on pretty much everything related to backend and databases.

**Generally,** I enjoy architecting and implementing robust, large-scale infrastructures (usually involving ML) that serve human-centric applications.

## Academic

**Currently,** I am no longer in school!

**Previously,** I received my Bachelor of Science in [Cognitive Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/undergraduate/prospective-students/academics/cognitive-science/index.html) with a minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) from Carnegie Mellon University. While at CMU, I had the pleasure to do research with [Saugata Ghose](https://ghose.web.illinois.edu/) on Computer Architecture and Operating Systems for the majority of my undergraduate career. I also completed graduate course work in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate-program/masters-program/msonline) at The University of Texas at Austin. I worked with professor [Amy Pavel](https://amypavel.com/) on some Human-AI Interaction research while I was there.

**Generally,** I find that I enjoy research topics in parallel systems, compilers, and human-computer interaction.

## Personal

Outside of my professional and academic interests I'm also passionate about [tricking](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuBzUssFYV3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), [esports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFIJFlpMRm4), anime and manga, and filmmaking.

I also love languages. Recently I've been [learning Japanese](/posts/japanese_six_months) in my free time ~~so that I can watch anime without subtitles~~.

You can find blog posts with detailed descriptions of my projects [here](/categories/project/). I also try my best to put my projects up on GitHub and keep them updated, but we all know that is rarely true :')

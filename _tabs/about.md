Hi! My name is William Liu (刘胥飞/劉胥飛). I am a software engineer, as well as a computer scientist and cognitive scientist, originally from Madison, Wisconsin.

**Currently** I am a Software Engineer at a [stealth startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_startup) (what a weird term) in Palo Alto, California. Our team is developing a new custom HPC and ML accelerator processor along with a robust compiler stack.

If you like PDFs, here are my [Résumé](../assets/cv/Rez_U_May.pdf) and [CV](../assets/cv/CV.pdf).

I received my Bachelor's in [Cognitive Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/undergraduate/prospective-students/academics/cognitive-science/index.html) and minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) from Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently pursuing my Master's in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate-program/masters-program) at The University of Texas at Austin part time.

I find that I am generally interested in high performance computing, compilers, systems design, computer architecture, theoretical neuroscience, deep learning, and teaching. If you'd like to have a conversation related to any of these topics, my email is below. I'd love to discuss any interesting projects or ideas (or anything really)!

At some point in the future I hope to pursue a PhD in Computer Science to do research at the intersection of systems architecture, high-performance computing, and formal mathematical analysis.

Outside of my technical interests I'm also passionate about [tricking](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuBzUssFYV3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), [esports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFIJFlpMRm4), [weeb stuff](https://myanimelist.net/profile/WilliXL), video game design, and [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aWsDC5iHxU).

You can find blog posts with detailed descriptions of my projects [here](/categories/Project/). I also try my best to put my projects up on GitHub and keep them updated, but we all know that is rarely true :')

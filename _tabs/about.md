Hi!

My name is William Liu (刘胥飞/劉胥飛/류서비). I am a software engineer, as well as a computer scientist and cognitive scientist.

Originally I am from Madison, Wisconsin but I am currently based in the SF Bay Area.

## Professional

**Currently,** I am a Backend Systems Engineer at [CoPilot](https://mycopilot.com/), a startup that's transforming the fitness, personal training, and health industry. As a backend engineer for a small team, I work on pretty much everything imaginable.

**Previously,** I was a Software Engineer at [SambaNova Systems](https://sambanova.ai/) where I worked on ML optimization and compiler development.

**Generally,** I enjoy developing robust, large-scale systems for new and unique applications (usually involving ML).

## Academic

**Currently,** I am pursuing a Master of Science in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate-program/masters-program/msonline) at The University of Texas at Austin, remotely part time. My thesis, advised by [Amy Pavel](https://amypavel.com/), is on Human-AI Interaction and collaboration in AR/VR.

**Previously,** I received my Bachelor of Science in [Cognitive Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/undergraduate/prospective-students/academics/cognitive-science/index.html) with a minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) from Carnegie Mellon University. While at CMU, I had the pleasure to do research with [Saugata Ghose](https://ghose.web.illinois.edu/) on Computer Architecture and Operating Systems for the majority of my undergraduate career.

**Generally,** I find that I am broadly interested in researching Parallel Systems/Algorithms, Domain-Specific Compilers, and Human-AI Interaction.

My email is in the side bar. Feel free to drop me an email about any of those research topics. I'm always happy to chat about interesting problems!

## Personal

Outside of my professional and academic interests I'm also passionate about [tricking](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuBzUssFYV3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), [esports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFIJFlpMRm4), [anime/manga](https://myanimelist.net/profile/liuwilliam47), video game design, and [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEvkbGgeq4k).

I also love languages. Recently I've been [learning Japanese](/posts/japanese_six_months) in my free time so that I can ~~watch anime without subtitles~~.

You can find blog posts with detailed descriptions of my projects [here](/categories/project/). I also try my best to put my projects up on GitHub and keep them updated, but we all know that is rarely true :')

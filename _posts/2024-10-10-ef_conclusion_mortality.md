Apparently part of the quarter life crisis is an increased fear of death.

For the first time in my life my metabolism has observably slowed down, my injuries don't heal that quickly if at all,
and the idea that I will be gone some day is really hitting me.

And if that's the case, should I be living life any differently?

## Life's Purpose?

So then before I die, what should I live it for?

Maybe this is why so many people feel so strongly about having children. I mean it makes sense. Children are an extremely
strong anchor for purpose. Even not thinking about it evolutionarily, raising and educating children must feel amazing
in that it's something to pour yourself into and have the joy of tangibly experiencing your effort.

Perhaps that's too reductive, but as someone without any children it's impossible to truly crest into the emotional
territory of understanding.

So should that be what I strive for?

It could be that I'm selfish but I'm scared to stop living my life for myself for now. Especially as I more seriously
entertain the startup lifestyle.

## Just Commit

I do have some idea of what my "life's mission" could be at this moment - right now it's making health and healthcare
available and financially accessible.

Of course, if you're any way familiar with the healthcare landscape in the US you would know that this is a huge
undertaking. So that's been leading me to the question: until there's any tangible evidence that this is even remotely
possible, how do I actually know this is what I want?

I feel like up until now, when there's people telling me what the "mission" is (and therefore telling me how to achieve)
it, it's been relatively easy to "flex" my thinking and quite easily align with their proposition.

But now I'm the sole person making the call that both: this is what I want to do with my life, and this is how I'm going
to achieve it.

So far, this has been incredibly difficult.

Previous startup ideas have fizzled out the moment I ran into difficulties because it was so easy to talk myself out of
effort when the end goal didn't fundamentally appeal to my "purpose".

This is something that the accelerator program [EF](https://joinef.com) talked about repeatedly during the beginning
portions of their programming. Startup idea exploration is almost an exercise in finding your life's purpose, at least
for the next decade, as it's extremely rough to commit wholly to something that you don't 1000% believe in.

I kept thinking, progressively, that every idea that we came up with throughout the EF program could be the one.

But how could I even tell? And committing, specifically if taking VC money, means that you're really gonna be all in for
at least a little while. VCs obviously don't like it if they give you money for a vision and you don't follow through on
it.

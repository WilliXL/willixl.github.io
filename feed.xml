Looking back on these 8 months, I realize now that I had no idea what I was doing when I first quit my job. My first ideas made no sense (especially business-wise). They were just interesting product ideas that had literally no grounding in business, revenue generation, or an... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>lately i've been scared of death</title><link href="https://williamliu.me/posts/ef_conclusion_mortality/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="lately i've been scared of death" /><published>2024-10-10T00:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2025-12-04T17:48:41-08:00</updated> <id>https://williamliu.me/posts/ef_conclusion_mortality/</id> <content src="https://williamliu.me/posts/ef_conclusion_mortality/" /> <author> <name>William Liu</name> </author> <category term="Startups" /> <summary> Apparently part of the quarter life crisis is an increased fear of death. For the first time in my life my metabolism has observably slowed down, my injuries don’t heal that quickly if at all, and the idea that I will be gone some day is really hitting me. And if that’s the case, should I be living life any differently? Life’s Purpose? So then before I die, what should I live it for? Maybe... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Why Write?</title><link href="https://williamliu.me/posts/why_do_i_write/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why Write?" /><published>2024-10-09T00:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2025-12-04T17:59:02-08:00</updated> <id>https://williamliu.me/posts/why_do_i_write/</id> <content src="https://williamliu.me/posts/why_do_i_write/" /> <author> <name>William Liu</name> </author> <summary> I’ve been thinking a lot about my personal motivations to write. There’s obviously the pedagogical reason - to impart some sort of knowledge or thought out into the world. But especially lately (circa 2024) as I’ve been primarily focused on startups and navigating my way through “what am I trying to do with life”, I’ve been feeling the itch to write for a different purpose. It’s almost like I... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Six Months of Japanese</title><link href="https://williamliu.me/posts/japanese_six_months/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Six Months of Japanese" /><published>2020-12-16T00:00:00-08:00</published> <updated>2025-12-04T17:18:45-08:00</updated> <id>https://williamliu.me/posts/japanese_six_months/</id> <content src="https://williamliu.me/posts/japanese_six_months/" /> <author> <name>William Liu</name> </author> <category term="Language Learning" /> <category term="Japanese" /> <summary> Last time I jotted down my thoughts on my Japanese learning, I was fairly optimistic about my progress. But there is just so much content and information to take in and seeing how little I am scratching the surface of understanding, I’ve been disheartened many times since then. But still, the weeb dream is still very much alive. I’m happy to say that those doubts were merely minor road bumps an... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Three Months of Japanese</title><link href="https://williamliu.me/posts/japanese_three_months/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Three Months of Japanese" /><published>2020-09-09T00:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2025-12-04T17:18:45-08:00</updated> <id>https://williamliu.me/posts/japanese_three_months/</id> <content src="https://williamliu.me/posts/japanese_three_months/" /> <author> <name>William Liu</name> </author> <category term="Language Learning" /> <category term="Japanese" /> <summary> Japanese media has been a big part of my life. Ever since I was watching Chinese-dubbed Dragon Ball till now, Japanese media is still the major source of my entertainment media. So it has always been a goal of mine to learn Japanese so that I can watch anime while eating and not miss anything connect more with this media that I am consuming. The Plan I am already casually fluent in Chinese (I... </summary> </entry> </feed>
